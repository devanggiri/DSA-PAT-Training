char vs varchar
eg: char(50) AND VARCHAR(50);
CHAR: INEFFICIENT MEMORY ALLOCATION, eg: it will reserve 50 BYTES, eventhough our string is holding 10 bytes, the rest 40 will be alocated and holding up the memory. (HOLDING EXTRA SPACE)
while in 
VARCHAR: it works on variability: will occupy space acc to the requirement, within its defined range. VARIABLE MEMORY ALLOCATION
