types of binary tree

Full Binary Tree- every node has 0 or 2 children
Degenerate Binary Tree - every internal node has one child
Skewed Binary Trees - the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes
Complete Binary Tree -  all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
Perfect Binary Tree - all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
Balanced Binary Tree  - the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.


#GRAPHS
undirected - travel both the sides
direccted- direction dependent travel
cyclic - form any type of cycle/circle (reach to initial vertex again after complete traversal)
ascyclic - irregular
weighted graph - edges hold some value (used to calculate distance)
un-connected graphs

#representation of graphs:
1) Adjacentary Matrix: matrix size = no. of vertices (eg, 5 vertice = 5x5 matrix) (fill the values with respect to the connection present in graph, rest 0, eg: Q values table)
2) List representation: create lists for each vertices/index and write their connections (0>{2,3}, 1>{3}, 2>{0,4},etc.)
